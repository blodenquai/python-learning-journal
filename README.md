A repository to document my Python learning journey
About Me
I am from the bay area and hope to go into finance in the future. I am taking this course because I believe that coding is an important skill to have for future careers and especially in the silicon valley.
Goals for This Course
My goals for this course are to have a simple understanding of coding and the ability to create simple projects in python. 
My First Python Program (include a simple "Hello, World!" program in a code block)
print("Hello World!")
